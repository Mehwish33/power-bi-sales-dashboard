# power-bi-sales-dashboard
This project involved the design and development of a comprehensive Category and Sub-Category Level Analysis Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI.
# Objective:
The primary goal of this dashboard was to provide a detailed, interactive view of sales and profit performance across different product categories, sub-categories, regions, and customer segments. This enables stakeholders to quickly identify trends, understand profit drivers, and make data-driven decisions.

# Key Features and Insights:

Hierarchical Analysis: Implemented drill-down capabilities for product categories and sub-categories to explore performance at granular levels.

Geographic and Segment Performance: Visualized sales and profit distribution across regions (Central, West, South) and customer segments (Corporate, Home Office, Small Business, Consumer) using a treemap, highlighting key contributing areas.

Sales and Quantity Trends: Presented monthly and quarterly sales and profit trends, revealing seasonal patterns and performance fluctuations.

Profitability Analysis: Utilized a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between quantity, sales, and profit at the sub-category level, aiding in the identification of high-performing or underperforming product lines.

Interactive Filtering: Incorporated slicers for Product Category and Product Sub-Category, allowing users to dynamically filter data and focus on specific areas of interest.
